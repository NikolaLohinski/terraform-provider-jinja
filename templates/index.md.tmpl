# Jinja provider

The "jinja" provider makes it possible to use [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating within Terraform context. This is a *logical provider*, which means that it works entirely within Terraform's logic, and doesn't interact with any other services.

The Jinja engine used under the hood is based on [the `gonja` Golang library](https://github.com/noirbizarre/gonja) and aims to be "mostly" compliant with the Jinja API. Moreover, the following additional features have been added on top of `gonja` for ease of use:
* A new filter called `ifelse` to allow for ternary conditions as follows:
  ```
  true is {{"{{"}} "foo" in "foo bar" | ifelse("yes", "no") {{"}}"}}
  false is {{"{{"}} "yolo" in "foo bar" | ifelse("yes", "no") {{"}}"}}
  ```
  Which will render into:
  ```
  true is yes
  false is no
  ```

The JSON schema validation engine is based on [the `jsonschema` Golang library](https://github.com/santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema).
