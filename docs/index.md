# Jinja provider

The "jinja" provider makes it possible to use [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating within Terraform context. This is a *logical provider*, which means that it works entirely within Terraform's logic, and doesn't interact with any other services.

## Example

```terraform
provider "jinja" {
  delimiters {
    // The values below are the defaults
    variable_start = "{{"
    variable_end   = "}}"
    block_start    = "{%"
    block_end      = "%}"
    comment_start  = "{#"
    comment_end    = "#}"
  }
  strict_undefined = true
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `delimiters` (Block List, Max: 1) Provider-wide custom delimiters for the jinja engine (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--delimiters))
- `strict_undefined` (Boolean) Provider-wide toggle to fail on missing attribute/item

<a id="nestedblock--delimiters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `delimiters`

Optional:

- `block_end` (String)
- `block_start` (String)
- `comment_end` (String)
- `comment_start` (String)
- `variable_end` (String)
- `variable_start` (String)

## Important considerations

The Jinja engine used under the hood is based on [the `gonja` Golang library](https://github.com/noirbizarre/gonja) and aims to be "mostly" compliant with the Jinja API. 

The [official Jinja API documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x) and especially the [list of builtin filters](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#list-of-builtin-filters) can be used as reference for using this provider. However, should the need for the exact implementation arise, one can easily refer to the `gonja` source code:

* for filters: https://github.com/noirbizarre/gonja/blob/master/builtins/filters.go
* for globals: https://github.com/noirbizarre/gonja/blob/master/builtins/globals.go
* for statements: https://github.com/noirbizarre/gonja/tree/master/builtins/statements

Finally, the JSON schema validation engine is based on [the `jsonschema` Golang library](https://github.com/santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema).

The following sections describe additional features that have been added to improve the developer experience.

### The `ifelse` filter

The `ifelse` filter is meant to perform ternary conditions as follows:

```
true is {{ "foo" in "foo bar" | ifelse("yes", "no") }}
false is {{ "yolo" in "foo bar" | ifelse("yes", "no") }}
```
Which will render into:
```
true is yes
false is no
```

### The `get` filter

The `get` filter helps getting an item in a map with a dynamic key:

```
{% set tac = "key" %}
{{ tic | get(tac) }}
```
With the following YAML context:
```
tic:
  key: toe
```
Will render into:
```
toe
```

### The `values` filter

The `values` filter is meant to get the values of a map as a list:

```
{{ numbers | values | sort | join(" > ") }}
```
With the following YAML context:
```
numbers:
  first: 1
  second: 2
  third: 3
```
Will render into:
```
1 > 2 > 3
```

Note that the order of values is not guaranteed as there is no ordering in Golang maps.

### The `keys` filter

The `keys` filter is meant to get the keys of a map as a list:

```
{{ letters | keys | sort | join(" > ") }}
```
With the following YAML context:
```
letters:
  a: hey
  b: bee
  c: see
```
Will render into:
```
a > b > c
```

Note that the order of keys is not guaranteed as there is no ordering in Golang maps.
